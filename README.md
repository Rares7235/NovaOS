# NovaOS
NovaOS on GitHub. Free download.
If you encounter any issues feel free to contact me on Discord. My username on Discord is Rares#7494. And i'll try my best to fix it
I am also searching for help, if you can work in NTLite then contact me on Discord. This is just a side hustle so there wont be any pay.
This is a torrent as the file size is larger than 15 mib.
Download for NovaOS based on Windows 11: https://mega.nz/file/EflmSDpJ#NAoCQN1GBNWoi8wVn2gulNecSCvrbMVNlvWSgW0wjYQ (I couldn't add the file to releases as its bigger than 2 gb)
Please add skip checks(or something like that) to the iso in rufus because i could not add them in NTLite
